### Local/State Policies + Assistance on Rent Deferment
\

* The City of Providence has created a guide to serve as a centralized resource for housing-related information and resources related to COVID-19. The guide contains information for Residential Renters, Single-Family Homeowners, Commercial Renters, and Landlords. Moreover, the state has set up Housing Help RI as a centralized location for Rhode Islanders to apply for emergency housing assistance. In addition to the $6.5 million the state has made available for assistance to low-income Rhode Islanders, the City of Providence has allocated an additional 769,000 Dollar for assistance to Providence residents.
